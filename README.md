Gordon Chaffee's Expect for Windows, as thankfully salvaged by Wayback Machine. Contents retrieved in Feb 2015 from https://web.archive.org/web/20090429043100/http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/expectnt.html.

The 'original-*' directories contain Gordon's last distributions, stable (5.21r1b1, from Nov 1997) and snapshot (29, from Apr 1999), as linked to on the above site. Note that the binary packages are actually "Eschalon Setup Loader" executables and do not lend to manual unpacking.

'Expect-5.21' contains the outcome of expect-5.21r1b1-setup.exe, as installed onto the root of C:\\.

'minimal-5.21' contains the smallest set of files needed for Expect to run (on Windows 7 SP1 at least). Mileage with your specific scripts may, of course, vary.
